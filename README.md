MoonShot Swift UI App:

Moonshot is an informational app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program.
At its core, the app is built in SwiftUI and it features multiple screens that display information about the Apollo's missions and its individual crew members. There are a total of 12 Apollo missions, from Apollo 7 to 17 along with the very first Apollo mission - Apollo 1.
As users tap on any of the listed Apollo missions, a new screen will display its mission highlights along with the astronaut crew members on that mission. Tapping on any of the astronaut crew members will display another screen with a description of the individual, such as their full name, birth date, deceased date (if any), university attended, accomplishments, etc.
All information on the missions and astronauts data are parsed and decoded from their associated JSON files - missions.json & astronauts.json. The images of astronauts and mission badges were all created by NASA, and they are available to use under a public domain license.
